# GoogleCollect
An endless runner game made using unity.
The projects consists of 2 parts - 
  1. Body detection (Python)
  2. Endless Runner game (Unity)

The python script runs on a desktop, whereas the unity code runs on an iPad.
The python code detects body tilt using mediapipe and opencv and sends that data to the iPad.
I have established a UDP socket connection between the Unity game and the python script for them to communicate.

Here is a small video of the execution-
